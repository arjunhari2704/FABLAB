 A fab lab is typically equipped with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials, with the aim to make "almost anything".This includes technology-enabled products generally perceived as limited to mass production.

While fab labs have yet to compete with mass production and its associated economies of scale in fabricating widely distributed products, they have already shown the potential to empower individuals to create smart devices for themselves. These devices can be tailored to local or personal needs in ways that are not practical or economical using mass production.

Our college is one of the few enginnering colleges which offers this facility. The fablab at MESCE Kuttippuram was opened in the year 2017. It is also one of the first college to set up such a lab in Kerala.

4. VINYL PRINTING

## LASER PRINTING
Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to cut materials, and is typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, but is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics. The laser optics and CNC (computer numerical control) are used to direct the material or the laser beam generated. A typical commercial laser for cutting materials would involve a motion control system to follow a CNC or G-code of the pattern to be cut onto the material. The focused laser beam is directed at the material, which then either melts, burns, vaporizes away, or is blown away by a jet of gas,[1] leaving an edge with a high-quality surface finish. Industrial laser cutters are used to cut flat-sheet material as well as structural and piping materials.

## 3D PRINTING
3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing (AM), refers to processes used to create a three-dimensional object in which layers of material are formed under computer control to create an object.Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and are produced using digital model data from a 3D model or another electronic data source such as an Additive Manufacturing File (AMF) file. STL is one of the most common file types that 3D printers can read. Thus, unlike material removed from a stock in the conventional machining process, 3D printing or AM builds a three-dimensional object from computer-aided design (CAD) model or AMF file by successively adding material layer by layer.

## CNC MACHINE
CNC machines are electro-mechanical devices that manipulate machine shop tools using computer programming inputs. The name CNC actually stands for Computer Numerical Control and it represents one of two common methods (3D printing technology like SLA, SLS/SLM, and FDM being the other) to generate prototypes from a digital software file.The first CNC machines were developed in the 1940s and 50s and relied on a common telecommunication data storage technology known as “punched tape” or “perforated paper tape.” Punched tape technology is long obsolete as the data medium quickly transitioned to analog and then digital computer processing in the 1950s and 1960s
CNC machines help one easy to make models out of wood and also helps in PCB designing.

## VINYL CUTTER
Vinyl printing is a method of printing that is generally limited to a 1 colour print. The artwork is required in a vector format which is produced in a software package i.e. Adobe Illustrator or Corel Draw, this artwork format produces the design in lines as opposed to pixels as in a jpeg image. The artwork is sent in mirror image to the vinyl cutter, which is very much like a large printer, however instead of using ink it uses a blade. Once the image has been etched into the vinyl, the vinyl can then be removed from the cutter. The excess vinyl surrounding the image can be weeded (removed) from the backing sheet, once this has removed you will be left with your design.

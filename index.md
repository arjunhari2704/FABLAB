  <b> FAB LAB </b>
  </p></font>
  
  A fab lab is typically equipped with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials, with the aim to make "almost anything".This includes technology-enabled products generally perceived as limited to mass production.

While fab labs have yet to compete with mass production and its associated economies of scale in fabricating widely distributed products, they have already shown the potential to empower individuals to create smart devices for themselves. These devices can be tailored to local or personal needs in ways that are not practical or economical using mass production.

Our college is one of the few enginnering colleges which offers this facility. The fablab at MESCE Kuttippuram was opened in the year 2017. It is also one of the first college to set up such a lab in Kerala.
